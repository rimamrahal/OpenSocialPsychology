    "text": "Preface\nSocial psychology is devoted to studying how individuals behave, think and feel within their social contexts. The field is therefore, by its very nature, set up for collaborative work. Leveraging the social context in which knowledge is generated is built in to the assumptions and interests that social psychology pursues. This fundamental attitude towards social embeddedness of knowledge is mirrored in the process by which this study book came to be. Through bringing together the work of students at Heidelberg University during the winter term of 2023, this volume offers diverse perspectives on a shared target topic: changing perceptions of classical social psychological research.\nSocial psychology lore is built on a strong set of classical research paradigms and findings, featured in many of the textbooks, syllabi, online courses and teaching guides that aspiring psychologists study with and established psychologists use as teaching resources. However, the common body of knowledge that social psychology relies on is undergoing change. Modern research methods and changing attitudes towards permissible research practices bring about social psychological research that looks much different today than it used. This book is dedicated to tracing some of these changes, and to offering a version of record of the changing perceptions and interpretations of classic social psychology in the light of it’s contemporary counterpart. As such, this study book is a snapshot of how we see social psychology today.\nBecause it tends to be difficult to keep teaching and study materials up to date with emerging trends and debates, we see this study book as an addition to traditional educational resources in social psychology, published as an Open Educational Resource to aid the accessibility of this knowledge for all, and to be adapted to teachers’ and learners’ needs as they dive into what social psychology has to offer.",

    "text": "This book contains several types of resources: narrative text, definitions and questions for reflection, as well as references.\nIn XX chapters, we provide narrative summaries about classical research in social psychology and its modern follow-up. Often, this means we include new attempts to show the same finding (replication attempts) or meta-analytical work that brings together a lot of evidence from different sources regarding a certain hypothesis. Each chapter contains an overview of the classic study, a summary of important work thereafter, as well as a conclusion.\nBecause this volume is targeted at students, we provide definitions of key terms, preceded by #definition and displayed like this:\n\n#definition Replication\nAn attempt to find the same result as a previous study in a new data set.\n\nWe have aimed at providing a critical but neutral perspective to the classical and modern studies of social psychology discussed in the texts of this volume. To help you develop your own perspective and a well-reflected attitude towards this work, you will find guiding questions and suggestions that might prompt you to think more deeply about what you read throughout the book. You’ll recognize these prompts by the preceding #yourturn. Here is an example of what these questions look like:\n\n#yourturn\nDo you think you might find such questions for reflection useful?\n\nFinally, we have enabled the option to collaboratively annotate this work using hypothesis (note that this is how links are formatted in this book) in the online version. Your annotations will be visible to others, and others will be able to see yours, so that we can build a better learning experience using this book together.\nTo read up on the original research we cite in this book, such as from Vazire (2018), you can hover over or click on the references provided.\nFeel free to make use of the resources in this book as you see fit. Our hope is that they will support you in building a well-reflected opinion about the existing body of knowledge in social psychology.\n\n\n\n\nVazire, Simine. 2018. “Implications of the Credibility Revolution for Productivity, Creativity, and Progress.” Perspectives on Psychological Science 13 (4): 411–17. https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691617751884.",

    "text": "The Role of Change for Scientific Discovery\nMuch of science capitalizes on change. It is the engine that drives progress and the expansion of knowledge (see Kuhn 1962; Popper 1959). Embracing change means taking established theories and challenging them to explore new directions. Changing perspectives, questioning the status quo, refining existing concepts, and adapting to new evidence provide the stuff that makes breakthroughs or new insights. In essence, change in science represents taking steps forward, toward greater insight and reality checks for the challenges we face. In other words, to push the boundaries of what we know, we must make change.\nIn the past decade, Open Science has made change, by transforming research practices to promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in scientific endeavors. By fostering a culture of openness and collaboration, Open Science has brought about a paradigm shift in research methodologies, paving the way for more robust and reliable scientific discoveries (Munafò et al. 2017; Vazire, Schiavone, and Bottesini 2022). It is certainly no small feat to fundamentally reform how research is done, and yet we have seen significant change towards Open practices (Kidwell et al. 2016; Chambers 2019; Christensen et al. 2020).",

    "section": "Challenges of Making Change",
    "text": "Challenges of Making Change\nChange can be a challenge because it disrupts established norms, habits, and power structures. This often means that individuals and groups might be hesitant to embrace change. Open Science as a reform to refocus on good research practice had to work with this difficulty of making change, where new methods, theories, or technologies often encounter skepticism and opposition from the scientific community. Open Science promotes transparency, data sharing, and collaborative research, which can expose flaws underlying previously held beliefs or reveal alternative interpretations. This shift can create debates about long-held ideas and established practices, which are scrutinized and potentially overturned. Established researchers may be reluctant to abandon familiar paradigms, and institutions may resist reallocating resources or altering well-known processes. Sometimes, inertia of traditional practices and fear of uncertainty can slow the adoption of innovative approaches, despite their potential to advance knowledge and solve pressing problems.\n\n#yourturn\nConsider a big change you have experienced. Was it easy to adapt to this change?\n\nHowever, a questioning attitude and focus on methodological rigor and good practice also enhance the robustness and reliability of scientific conclusions by fostering an environment where continuous re-evaluation is encouraged. Thus, Open Science exemplifies how embracing change can lead to a more dynamic and resilient understanding of the world, even as it unsettles the familiar foundations of scientific consensus.\nChange often implies the potential for a changed perception of what used to be, particularly in comparison to what is now. This is also the case in the scope of changes assosciated with Open Science. In particular, what were once considered unassailable facts can become contested or uncertain as new methodologies, data, and technologies challenge established knowledge. This is where our focus lies in this book: reporting on classical studies in social psychology and the change in how they are seen now, following a wave of additional research (often with an Open Science flavor).\n\n#yourturn\n“I was today years old when I found out …” What was the last long-held belief you had to give up?\n\nIn this spirit, when reading about the changes in perspective about classics in social psychology, there are two things to embrace:\nOn the one hand, revisiting classic social psychology studies is a demonstration on the profound impact they had on the field. Were they less important and less impactful, these studies would not draw continued debate, research interest and investment of resources. Therefore, reading classic studies can give readers a sense of what matters to social psychological research, from hot topics to hot paradigms and research methods.\nOn the other hand, following the course of the academic debate about these claims, insights and phenomena allows us to hone our skills in accumulating insights and adjusting our perception of the currently held beliefs in this area of research. Put differently, tracing efforts to replicate, to conduct meta-analyses or to establish boundary conditions to the findings postulated in a certain study mostly reflects well-intentioned interest in assessing the validity of the claims of the original study, attempting to produce clarity about our collective knowledge about the phenomenon of interest. Reassessing classical studies might require change in opinions, calibration and reflection, but it can surely spark renewed trust in research and in its ability to refine and build our joint knowledge.\n\n\n\n\nChambers, Chris. 2019. “The Registered Reports Revolution Lessons in Cultural Reform.” Significance 16 (4): 23–27.\n\n\nChristensen, Garret, Zenan Wang, Elizabeth Levy Paluck, Nicholas Swanson, David Birke, Edward Miguel, and Rebecca Littman. 2020. “Open Science Practices Are on the Rise: The State of Social Science (3S) Survey.”\n\n\nKidwell, Mallory C, Ljiljana B Lazarević, Erica Baranski, Tom E Hardwicke, Sarah Piechowski, Lina-Sophia Falkenberg, Curtis Kennett, et al. 2016. “Badges to Acknowledge Open Practices: A Simple, Low-Cost, Effective Method for Increasing Transparency.” PLoS Biology 14 (5): e1002456.\n\n\nKuhn, Thomas. 1962. “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.” International Encyclopedia of Unified Science 2 (2).\n\n\nMunafò, Marcus R, Brian A Nosek, Dorothy VM Bishop, Katherine S Button, Christopher D Chambers, Nathalie Percie du Sert, Uri Simonsohn, Eric-Jan Wagenmakers, Jennifer J Ware, and John Ioannidis. 2017. “A Manifesto for Reproducible Science.” Nature Human Behaviour 1 (1): 1–9.\n\n\nPopper, Karl R. 1959.

    "section": "",
    "text": "1.1 The Classic\nEgo depletion is a social psychological concept that describes the depletion of individuals’ self-regulatory resources. Baumeister et al. (1998) were the first to demonstrate an ego depletion effect by investigating the effects of a preceding act of self-control in four different experimental settings. In Experiment 1, the focus was placed on the act of resisting a temptation by first assigning participants to different food conditions, i.e. the independent variables: Chocolate, radish or no food at all (control group). Participants in the radish control condition were instructed to resist the tempting chocolates and instead eat the radish that was next to the chocolate. The whole thing was disguised with a cover story. After the test subjects had completed the first “willpower task”, they had to complete questionnaires on mood and restraint and then “solve” an unsolvable problem-solving task in which the time spent solving the problem was the dependent variable.\nThe results showed significant differences between the three conditions, with participants in the radish condition stopping earlier than those in the chocolate or no-food condition (\\(F(2, 64) = 26.88, p &lt; .001\\)). In conclusion, it was hypothesized that craving chocolate but choosing to eat radishes, even in seemingly simple and safe circumstances, depleted an internal resource, leaving individuals less able to solve the puzzles.",

    "section": "1.2 The Aftermath",
    "text": "1.2 The Aftermath\nSince this study, many replications and meta-analyses have been carried out. Building on the meta-study by Carter et al. (2015), the meta-analysis conducted by Dang, Liu, Liu and Mao (2017) aimed to investigate the ego depletion effect, focusing on whether initial effort, particularly the depleting task, has a significant impact. The study’s inclusion criteria required the depleting task to be a valid measure of self-control and to exclude factors such as social exclusion. The new experiments also included an exhaustion condition and a control condition. Methodologically, Hedges g and the random effects model were used here, as well as the trim-and-fill method for publication bias correction. Eight commonly used depletion tasks were analyzed, namely attention essay, attention video, crossing out letters, emotion video, food trial, Stroop, thought suppression, and working memory.\nThe results showed that two exhaustive tasks, namely attention video and working memory, had no statistically significant effect on subsequent self-control. Due to the limited sample size, the effect of challenging math tasks and transcription could not be estimated. Emotion videos, on the other hand, appeared to be the most effective. The overall analysis revealed a small to medium effect size for the ego depletion effect, which remained significant after bias correction. A separate analysis for reliable depletion tasks, such as attention essay, emotion video and Stroop, confirmed the significant effect and reduced heterogeneity. With regard to the overall effect of ego depletion, the meta-analysis revealed a small to moderate effect size (g=0.24), but its effect was not classified as statistically significant.\nThe results suggest a differentiated view of the finite resource of willpower. Although the meta-analysis supports the idea of ego depletion, it emphasizes above all the importance of the effectiveness of the depletion task for the ego depletion effect.",

    "text": "1.3 Conclusion\nIn the context of social psychological theories, this effect can be seen as a prime example of contradictory and publication-biased findings in research. It demonstrates that one-off effects can only be confirmed through multiple empirical research, including many replications that can provide a more realistic picture of the effect or construct. This is because the ego-depletion effect was also initially subject to publication bias, i.e. the preference for the publication of studies with “positive” or significant results in scientific journals and was only examined in more detail following the replication crisis in 2015. The meta- analysis shows well how important it is to examine individual variables (in this case the type of depleting task) under the microscope in order to ensure the quality criteria that are essential for evidence of the overall effect.",
