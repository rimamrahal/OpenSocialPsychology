## The Classic

Ego depletion is a social psychological concept that describes the depletion of individuals' self-regulatory resources. Baumeister et al. (1998) were the first to demonstrate an ego depletion effect by investigating the effects of a preceding act of self-control in four different experimental settings. In Experiment 1, the focus was placed on the act of resisting a temptation by first assigning participants to different food conditions, i.e. the independent variables: Chocolate, radish or no food at all (control group). Participants in the radish control condition were instructed to resist the tempting chocolates and instead eat the radish that was next to the chocolate. The whole thing was disguised with a cover story. After the test subjects had completed the first "willpower task", they had to complete questionnaires on mood and restraint and then "solve" an unsolvable problem-solving task in which the time spent solving the problem was the dependent variable.

The results showed significant differences between the three conditions, with participants in the radish condition stopping earlier than those in the chocolate or no-food condition ($F(2, 64) = 26.88, p < .001$). In conclusion, it was hypothesized that craving chocolate but choosing to eat radishes, even in seemingly simple and safe circumstances, depleted an internal resource, leaving individuals less able to solve the puzzles.

## The Aftermath

Since this study, many replications and meta-analyses have been carried out. Building on the meta-study by Carter et al. (2015), the meta-analysis conducted by Dang, Liu, Liu and Mao (2017) aimed to investigate the ego depletion effect, focusing on whether initial effort, particularly the depleting task, has a significant impact. The study's inclusion criteria required the depleting task to be a valid measure of self-control and to exclude factors such as social exclusion. The new experiments also included an exhaustion condition and a control condition. Methodologically, Hedges g and the random effects model were used here, as well as the trim-and-fill method for publication bias correction. Eight commonly used depletion tasks were analyzed, namely attention essay, attention video, crossing out letters, emotion video, food trial, Stroop, thought suppression, and working memory.

The results showed that two exhaustive tasks, namely attention video and working memory, had no statistically significant effect on subsequent self-control. Due to the limited sample size, the effect of challenging math tasks and transcription could not be estimated. Emotion videos, on the other hand, appeared to be the most effective. The overall analysis revealed a small to medium effect size for the ego depletion effect, which remained significant after bias correction. A separate analysis for reliable depletion tasks, such as attention essay, emotion video and Stroop, confirmed the significant effect and reduced heterogeneity. With regard to the overall effect of ego depletion, the meta-analysis revealed a small to moderate effect size (g=0.24), but its effect was not classified as statistically significant.

The results suggest a differentiated view of the finite resource of willpower. Although the meta-analysis supports the idea of ego depletion, it emphasizes above all the importance of the effectiveness of the depletion task for the ego depletion effect.

## Conclusion

In the context of social psychological theories, this effect can be seen as a prime example of contradictory and publication-biased findings in research. It demonstrates that one-off effects can only be confirmed through multiple empirical research, including many replications that can provide a more realistic picture of the effect or construct. This is because the ego-depletion effect was also initially subject to publication bias, i.e. the preference for the publication of studies with "positive" or significant results in scientific journals and was only examined in more detail following the replication crisis in 2015. The meta- analysis shows well how important it is to examine individual variables (in this case the type of depleting task) under the microscope in order to ensure the quality criteria that are essential for evidence of the overall effect.
